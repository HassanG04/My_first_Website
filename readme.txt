This is was my first attempt on making a functioning website after the information I gathered,
I used GeeksforGeeks,
       AI lectures
       DeepSeek and Chatgpt in order to perfect the website.
I loved making this website as it opened to me many doors towards achieving frontend & backend skills
due to the unlimited potential web development has,
this was a great opportunity to express creativity and freedom and learn more interesting
features about CSS and JS
I will return for future projects
