This is my portfolio (a quick introduction) and my first attempt at front-end development!

I used GeeksforGeeks,
       AI lectures
       DeepSeek and Chatgpt in order to perfect the website.
this was a great opportunity to express creativity and freedom and learn more interesting
features about CSS and JS
I will return for future projects
